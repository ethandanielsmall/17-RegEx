## The Purpose

You are a social media user and you have a phobia of kittens. So, you want to implement something that will find tweets with '#kittens' and block them from view.

Or, you are a password generator, and you do not want to give the same person the same password twice.

In both instances, you need something that can go through arrays of information and find matches or patterns, so that something can be done with them. That is exactly the job for regular expressions.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
